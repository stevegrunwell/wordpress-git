# Keeping WordPress Under [Version] Control with Git

Learn how to keep your WordPress sites under version control using a git workflow refined over dozens of sites. We’ll cover repository organization, what belongs (and, perhaps more importantly, what doesn’t belong), and how to make deploying updates and working with multiple environments as painless as possible.

Please note that this presentation is not an introduction to Git nor version control. While Git experience is not mandatory it’s recommended that you have some understanding of version control going into the talk.

This presentation is based on my [blog post of the same name](http://stevegrunwell.com/blog/keeping-wordpress-under-version-control-with-git/) and is powered by [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
